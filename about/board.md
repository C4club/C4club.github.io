                    When I was three years old, I had a hemangioma on my scalp surgically removed. As I grew up, I realized how the treatment had improved my lifestyle and self-confidence, and I became interested in the field of tumors and cancer. After volunteering a summer to spend time with young cancer patients undergoing treatment, I decided to start a club dedicated to boosting their morale.

                    When I was a baby, I had an astrocytoma - a tumour formed in my brain. I don’t remember much but I still go for MRIs every two years. My last one will be next summer! The doctors who worked with my family and me were so kind and willing to go the extra mile for me. Being a part of C4 is my way of giving back to the doctors who helped me and are helping everyone through those trying times.

                    Growing up with sickle cell, the improvement of medical techniques in methods such as hydroxyurea and bone marrow transplant highlighted the importance of research to further treatment. I joined C4 as the club’s mission of raising funds for children cancer treatments specifically resonated with me, and I hope through the club's efforts children around the world can experience the same hope that new research brought me.

                    Having cancer is something nobody should have to go through. Yet, over 11,000 children are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2020 alone. I joined C4 because it gives me, and many other people, an opportunity and a platform to help as many of those children as we can.
