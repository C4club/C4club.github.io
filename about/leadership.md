                    I was born with multiple hemangiomas , one surgically removed when I was three years old. As I grew up, I realized how the treatment had improved my lifestyle and self-confidence, and I became interested in the field of tumors and cancer. After volunteering a summer to spend time with young cancer patients undergoing treatment, I decided to start a club dedicated to boosting their morale.

                    When I was a baby, I had an astrocytoma - a tumour formed in my brain. I don’t remember much but I still go for MRIs every two years. My last one will be next summer! The doctors who worked with my family and me were so kind and willing to go the extra mile for me. Being a part of C4 is my way of giving back to the doctors who helped me and are helping everyone through those trying times.

                    Cancer induces agonizing symptoms in not only the physical and health conditions, but also the mental and emotional conditions of over tens of thousands of children in the US. I joined C4 to help provide support to these children by boosting their morale in what ways I can. I hope that our club’s efforts can contribute to helping these children achieve their dreams.

                    Cancer is a horrible disease that affects millions of people. It is really tough to go through, physically, mentally, and emotionally especially for children. It can affect anyone anytime and turn their lives upside down. The cost of cancer treatment also greatly burdens families. I joined C4 to help do my part in combatting childhood cancer.

                    Growing up with sickle cell, the improvement of medical techniques in methods such as hydroxyurea and bone marrow transplant highlighted the importance of research to further treatment. I joined C4 as the club’s mission of raising funds for children cancer treatments specifically resonated with me, and I hope through the club's efforts children around the world can experience the same hope that new research brought me.

                    Having cancer is something nobody should have to go through. Yet, over 11,000 children are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2020 alone. I joined C4 because it gives me, and many other people, an opportunity and a platform to help as many of those children as we can.

                    I joined 4 because cancer is such a scary and huge problem in the world with severe treatments, and no one should have to deal with it, let alone children. The least we can do is help in whatever way possible, whether it be donating money so families of children with cancer don’t have to worry about it or just bringing comfort to these strong children.

                    An individual’s well being directly influences their ability to not only pursue goals, but also lead a fulfilling life. With that being said, it is critical that citizens ensure that those suffering from illnesses are able to obtain the assistance necessary so that all societal members have the opportunity to prosper. I joined C4 for the purpose of assuring that cancer will not impede children from flourishing in all their endeavors.
