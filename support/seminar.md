C4 is proud to announce our first Golden Seminar! The Golden Seminar will be held in mid-January virtually with the goal of spreading childhood cancer awareness among students as they explore childhood cancer research and treatment by focusing on their areas of interest. 

## Presenters

We are currently accepting applications for Presenters who will talk about a specific topic of their choice pertaining to the research/treatment/after-effects of childhood cancer to the attendees of the seminar. The presentation will be around 15 minutes maximum and 5 minutes minimum. Presenters should also be ready to answer questions attendees may have. The logistics of the seminar will be geared towards our presenter's preferences so there is a section in this form about that.  

In order to register as a student presenter, you must fill out this form below. Note: You do NOT have to be part of a C4 club to present at or attend the seminar. Our seminar will be held sometime in January. Based on the response we get, we will set the specific date/time(s) of the seminar sometime in November/December.  

This form does ask for your school/university information. This is only so that we can ensure that you are a real student in order to maintain the security of our seminar.

 Once you fill out this form, we will get back to you within 2 weeks with your presenter status. If you are approved, by December 15th, we will require that you send an abstract or your presentation to us for project approval. Thanks for showing interest and we hope to see you at our seminar!
