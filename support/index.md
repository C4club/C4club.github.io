## Organizations to Donate to 

C4 donates to several organizations such as Children’s National Hospital, St. Judes Research Hospital, and the National Foundation for Cancer Research. A big part of supporting our mission is supporting these organizations, which you can do by participating in our fundraisers throughout the year. Be on the lookout for upcoming fundraisers and make sure to come out and support!  

You can also support these organizations individually as they are always open to monetary donations and some are open to other supplies and gifts as well.  
Some organizations:

- [Children’s National Hospital](https://childrensnational.org/visit/resources-for-families/family-services/volunteer/donations)
- [St. Judes Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html)
- [National Foundation for Cancer Research](https://nfcr.org/ways-to-give)

## Frontline Worker Google Form

Our fronline workers do an amazing job protecting and helping us. We'd like to do our part to thank them for the work they do. Below is a Google Form open to anyone who would like to submit an encouraging note to frontline workers. Notes will be sent out every week by our officers to different organizations. You have the option to be anonymous and to have your note be sent out every week. Please take out two minutes to fill out this form!
