## History

As a group, the C4 club is dedicated to hosting fundraisers in the local community of Poolesville with the majority of such fundraisers occurring on the premises of Poolesville High School. Throughout the years of the club’s establishment, we have raised over $900 through a variety of events.  

## General Fundraisers

The main fundraising method of the C4 club resolves around selling goods at the school. We have had holiday-themed sales in which we sold items associated with Valentines, Christmas, etc. We have also hosted mini competitions such as a coin drive between grade levels. Although less common, we have also been able to accrue funds by accepting straight donations to the club. Outside of monetary funds, as a club we have also worked to collect and design cards and coloring books to send to child cancer patients at various hospitals. To the same patients, we have also donated brand new toys.

For future fundraisers, we have plans to continue implementing our old methods of fundraising, but at the same time, we want to add several new methods such as a walkathon to raise funds. As a club we are also planning a Spring Fair to act as a huge fundraiser; the plan was to host this fair during April of 2020. However, due to COVID-19, it has postponed until it is safe to have the event.

## Spring Fair

The Combating Childhood Cancer Club decided to have a Spring Fair on April 18, 2020 in order to raise money for childhood cancer research at the National Foundation for Cancer Research. The fair was to be at Whalen Commons, a public field in the town of Poolesville. This fair would have been open to the public, with a large number of our attendees to be of Poolesville. Due to the COVID-19, we first postponed the fair to October 10th, 2020, and then decided to postpone the fair indefinitely. However, before postponing, we had planned the fair to a great extent. Our plan for the fair consisted of:  

- Pie in the Face
- Balloon Darts
- Face Painting
- Ring Toss
- Spin the Wheel
- Art competitions
- Flag Football Scrimmages
- Concerts led by student bands
- Food trucks and partnerships
- Student-run bake sale

Due to this year's circumstances, we weren't able to hold the fair, but we were able to:

- Plan carnival booths and finalize the list of items to be ordered according to our budget -Secure partnerships with local businesses such as Poolesville Subway and Kristopher’s Pizza along with food trucks like Kona’s Ice in order for them to donate a certain percentage of their revenue towards our cause on the day of the fair
- Present to Poolesville Community Town Hall in order to secure park permit to use Whalen Commons for the fair
- Expand Combating Childhood Cancer Club to local middle and elementary schools in order to combine ideas and funds. In order to do this, the Combating Childhood Cancer Club officers first presented the fair idea to local principals and country representatives in order to first gain permission. Then the club officers traveled to each school to present the club mission and fair idea to SGAs of these schools in order to get younger kids involved.
- Finalize posters and begin advertising on social media about the fair
