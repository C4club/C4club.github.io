Each week, we are planning to provide multiple-slide & single-slide posts to our followers and viewers. We are
doing this in order to educate about childhood cancer and increase awareness of our C4 accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and our blog. We hope to increase the amount of followers we currently have, encourage people to join our club & our overall efforts, as well as help people educate themselves on the general subject of childhood cancer through different perspectives.  

Here are some of the categories:

- Science/Medical Research
  - Letâ€™s talk about Chemotherapy, a commonly used type of systemic therapy used in treatment plans for many children.
  - There is a variety of social, mental, and psychological effects that come from having childhood cancer.
- Healthcare Practice
- Ethics
  - Older minors: Should they be able to supersede their parents wishes about treatment?
- Informative Resources (providing these so people have the credible resources they need in order to educate themselves)
- Trustworthy Organizations To Donate To
- Common Misconceptions
- Careers
- Quotes/Short Stories
