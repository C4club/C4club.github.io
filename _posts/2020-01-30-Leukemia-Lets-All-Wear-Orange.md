## What is Leukemia? And how is it caused?

Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the body’s blood forming tissues and bone marrows and other parts of the Lymphatic system. There are many different types of Leukemia as well as different stages that occur in different people, age groups, and genders. It is said that specific types of leukemia are the most common in young children while the rest are common in adults. Leukemia involves white blood cells which are protectors for your body; they grow and divide as your body needs them. However, people who are diagnosed with Leukemia don’t have these potent infection fighters in their bone marrow, instead they produce an “abnormal” type of white blood cells which don’t function the way they are supposed to. 

## Symptoms? 

Once again with the many different types of Leukemia cancers, the symptoms depend accordingly. With the many variations of symptoms leukemia can be hard to detect at some times. Some symptoms are more normal than others meaning that they may not seem like symptoms of cancer at the time even though they really are. Symptoms can include fever or chills, fatigue, severe body weakness, weight loss swollen lymph nodes, easy bruising/bleeding, petechiae (tiny red spots), and bone pain/tenderness. 

## Diagnosis:

It is very important to see your doctor if you are experiencing any type of symptoms that are mentioned above before the cancer drastically advances. Most chronic leukemia can be easily found through a simple blood test. Blood tests are easy in a way doctors only need to draw blood and wait for results. Even before one experiences any symptoms chronic leukemia can be detected beforehand which is why having your routine blood drawn is very important for everyone to stay healthy and aware of everything that's happened to them. Other diagnoses that can happen include a physical exam where your doctor will look for any physical indications of leukemia. These include anything like pale skin from Anemia, swelling of lymph nodes, or enlargement of the spleen or liver. Other ways that doctors can test for leukemia include blood and bone marrow tests.

Once again leukemia treatment depends on many factors. With all of the different types of leukemia there are many contributions for treating it. Treatments are determined by the doctor based on age, gender, overall health, and the type of leukemia. The most common way to treat leukemia, or any cancer is through chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a drug treat manet that is used to kill any cancer cells. Chemotherapy has worked for many people who endure leukemia. Drugs can be given to a person through pills or needles that are injected through the person's veins. Another treatment that is used for most cancer peiantendt includes radiation therapy which is not as efficient as chemotherapy but is definitely used to attempt to treat leukemia.
