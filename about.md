The Combating Childhood Cancer Club (C4) is a club founded at Poolesville High School in 2018. C4â€™s mission is to raise money for pediatric cancer patients. Money raised goes towards buying toys for them and supporting their hospital oncology departments. Recently, C4 has also started supporting childhood cancer research efforts, and currently, C4 is working to support frontline workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak.
