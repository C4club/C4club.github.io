                    Hello, I’m Yeicy Ramirez. My pronouns are she/her. I’m the President of c4 Damascus. This club has so much meaning to me because I had close family members that had cancer. I know the amount of fear and stress that comes with battling cancer. I want them to know we are here to help in anyway we can. I believe in C4 and our mission to make a positive impact in our county. I am determined to make change and I will make an effort to bring more awareness to the young ones who need support!

                    Howdy! My name is Gianna Filoia, the Secretary for the new C4 chapter at Damascus High School. I joined because cancer is a battle that is best fought when you have backup. C4 to me is one of the best opportunities out there for teens who want to help!

                    Hi, I'm Jordan Lynch, the Outreach Officer of Damascus C4! I love how C4 is able to help with cancer research, education and support. I can't wait to work with all of you!

                    Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of 15, and it’s a tragic disease that takes a huge toll on the patient’s mental and physical health. I joined C4 because these patients need the love and validation that they deserve, and I wish to aid them in anyway possible. Together in C4, I know that we’ll be able to make a difference in our community.

                    Hi! My name is Sierra Lynch and I’m the publicity officer of C4 Damascus. I’m very passionate about what C4 stands for, especially after watching someone I’m close to battle cancer. It’s very important for our community to do whatever we can to help those with cancer.

                    While I haven’t directly been affected by cancer I know many people that have. Nobody should have to go through what cancer patients go through and if by joining C4 I can help in any way at all than that’s what I am going to do. I hope that through this incredible club I can make a difference in the lives of those who are diagnosed with cancer.
